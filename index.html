			<h2>take a knee</h2>
			<p>#TakeAKnee refers to a hashtag used regarding United States President Donald Trump’s comments about controversial San Fransisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who infamously does not stand for the American National Anthem as a means of protest against racial inequality and police brutality across America.<br><br>During a speech made in Alabama, Trump called Kaepernick a “son of a bitch” who should be “fired.” Many NFL officials, players and fans rallied around Kaepernick by issuing statements about the President’s comments and engaging in protest during games by taking a knee and/or locking arms during the national anthem, while others refused to leave the locker room during the song.
