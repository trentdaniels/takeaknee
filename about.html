			<p>The Take a Knee movement was started by quarterback Colin Kaepernick who knelt before a pre-season game for the San Francisco 49ers in 2016. Kaepernick had said: “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.” He also stated that "to me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”<br><br>NFL players and owners across the US knelt or stood with arms their arms linked during the national anthem to highlight racial injustice and police brutality in America, on Sunday, September 24.<br><br>The poignant display has been adopted by the Black Lives Matter movement.<br><br>Other footballers have followed in Kaepernick's footsteps and a verbal attack on those who protest by Trump prompted the largest-scale anti-racism protests in the league yet.</p>
